Title: From gprofiler2 to Cytoscape network
Description: This package enables the transformation of 
    functional enrichment results obtained by gprofiler2 into a Cytoscape 
    network where significant terms 
    (Gene Ontology/Reactome/Kegg/Transcription Factor/etc..) and genes 
    are nodes. In this network, edges connect genes that are part of the 
    enrichment request to their terms. The gprofiler2cytoscape package offers 
    the option to generate a network for only a portion of the significant 
    terms by selecting the source or by providing a specific list of terms.
