\title{The result of an enrichment analysis has been done using the significantly 
differentially expressed genes between napabucasin treated and DMSO 
control parental MiaPaCa2 cells, as published in Froeling F.E.M. et al 2019.
The cells were treated for 2 hour with 0.5 uM napabucasin.}
\format{
a \code{data.frame} containing the results of a differential 
expression analysis between napabucasin treated and DMSO control parental 
MiaPaCa2 cells for all 24184 genes tested. The 4 columns are:
\itemize{
\item{EnsemblID} {a \code{character} string representing the unique Ensembl 
identifier for the tested gene}
\item{EnsemblID} {a \code{numeric} representing the expression difference 
(in log2FoldChange) between the napabucasin treatment and the DMSO control 
for the tested gene}
\item{padj} {a \code{numeric} representing the adjusted p-value associated  
to the difference in expression for the tested gene}
\item{GeneName} {a \code{character} string representing the name of 
the tested gene}
}
}
\source{
The original RNA-sequencing data is available at the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE135352.

\description{
The enrichment analysis was done with gprofile2 package 
(Kolberg L et al 2020) with database version 'e109_eg56_p17_1d3191d' and 
g:SCS multiple testing correction method applying significance 
threshold of 0.05 (Raudvere U et al 2019).

\details{
The object is a named \code{list} with 2 entries. The 'result' entry 
contains a \code{data.frame} with the enrichment analysis results and 
the 'meta' entry contains metadata infomration.

associated to this publication:
