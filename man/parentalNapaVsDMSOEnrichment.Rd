\title{The result of an enrichment analysis has been done using the significantly 
differentially expressed genes between napabucasin treated and DMSO 
control parental MiaPaCa2 cells. 
The cells were treated for 2 hour with 0.5 uM napabucasin.  
The protocol to generate the RNA-seq is described 
in Froeling F.E.M. et al 2019.}

\description{
The enrichment analysis was done with gprofile2 package 
(Kolberg L et al 2020) with database version 'e109_eg56_p17_1d3191d' and 
g:SCS multiple testing correction method applying significance 
threshold of 0.05 (Raudvere U et al 2019). All tested genes were used 
as background.

The object is a named \code{list} with 2 entries. The 'result' entry 
contains a \code{data.frame} with the enrichment analysis results and 
the 'meta' entry contains metadata information.
