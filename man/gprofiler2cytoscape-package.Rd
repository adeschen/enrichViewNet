\title{From gprofiler2 to Cytoscape network}
\description{
The \code{gprofiler2cytoscape} package enables the visualization 
of enrichment results obtained by \code{gprofiler2} 
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/index.html})  
under the form of \code{Cytoscape} network (\url{https://cytoscape.org/}).
}
\details{
In those networks, both gene datasets (GO terms/pathways/protein complexes)
and genes are represented as nodes. A edge connect a gene to its datasets.
In the current version, only genes present in at least one gene dataset 
are retained.
