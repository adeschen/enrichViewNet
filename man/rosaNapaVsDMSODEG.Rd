\title{The result of a differential expression analysis done between 
napabucasin treated and DMSO control MiaPaCa2 cells stably expressing 
the Rosa26 control vector. The cells were treated for 2 hour 
with 0.5 uM napabucasin.
The protocol to generate the RNA-seq is described 
in Froeling F.E.M. et al 2019.}
\format{
a \code{data.frame} containing the results of a differential 
expression analysis between napabucasin treated and DMSO control MiaPaCa2 
cells stably expressing the Rosa26 control vector for all 23542 genes 
tested. The 4 columns are:
\itemize{
\item{EnsemblID} {a \code{character} string representing the unique Ensembl 
identifier for the tested gene}
\item{EnsemblID} {a \code{numeric} representing the expression difference 
(in log2FoldChange) between the napabucasin treatment and the DMSO control 
for the tested gene}
\item{padj} {a \code{numeric} representing the adjusted p-value associated  
to the difference in expression for the tested gene}
\item{GeneName} {a \code{character} string representing the name of 
the tested gene}
}
}

The original RNA-sequencing data is available at the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE135352.
