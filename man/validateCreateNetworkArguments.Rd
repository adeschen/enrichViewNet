\usage{
validateCreateNetworkArguments(
  gostObject,
  source,
  termIDs,
  removeRoot,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gostObject}{a \code{list} created by \code{gprofiler2} that contains
the results from an enrichment analysis.}

\item{source}{a \code{character} string representing the selected source 
that will be used to generate the network. To hand-pick the terms to be 
used, "TERM_ID" should be used and the list of selected term IDs should
be passed through the \code{termIDs} parameter. The possible sources are 
"GO:BP" for Gene Ontology Biological Process, "GO:CC" for Gene Ontology  
Cellular Component, "GO:MF" for Gene Ontology Molecular Function, 
"KEGG" for Kegg, "REAC" for Reactome, "TF" for TRANSFAC, "MIRNA" for 
miRTarBase, "CORUM" for CORUM database, "HP" for Human phenotype ontology
and "WP" for WikiPathways.}

\item{termIDs}{a \code{vector} of \code{character} strings that contains 
the term IDs retained for the creation of the network. This parameter is 
only used when \code{source} is set to "TERM_ID".}

\item{removeRoot}{a \code{logical} that specified if the root terms of 
the selected source should be removed (when present).}

\item{fileName}{a \code{character} string representing the name of the
CX JSON file that is created when Cytoscape is not running. The name 
must have a '.cx' extension.}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} when all arguments are valid
}
\description{
Validate the arguments passed to creatNetwork() function.
First, the object containing the enrichment results must correspond to a 
object created by  \code{gprofiler2} software. Second, the selected 
source must at least have one enriched term in the results. Then, if the
source is 'TERM_ID', the listed terms must be present in the enrichment
results.
}
\examples{

## Load the result of an enrichment analysis done with gprofiler2
data(demoGOST)

## Check that all arguments are valid
gprofiler2cytoscape:::validateCreateNetworkArguments(gostObject=demoGOST,
    source="GO:BP", termIDs=NULL, removeRoot=FALSE, fileName="test.cx")
