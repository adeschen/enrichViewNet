\title{The result of an enrichment analysis that has been done using the 
significantly differentially expressed genes between 
napabucasin treated and DMSO control MiaPaCa2 cells stably expressing 
the Rosa26 control vector.
The cells were treated for 2 hour with 0.5 uM napabucasin.  
The protocol to generate the RNA-seq is described 
in Froeling F.E.M. et al 2019.}
\format{
a \code{list} created by gprofiler2 that contains the results 
from the enrichment analysis:
\itemize{
    \item{result}{  a \code{data.frame} with the significantly enriched 
    terms }
    \item{meta}{  a \code{list} with the meta-data information}
}

The original RNA-sequencing data is available at the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE135352.

\description{
The enrichment analysis was done with gprofile2 package 
(Kolberg L et al 2020) with database version 'e109_eg56_p17_1d3191d' and 
g:SCS multiple testing correction method applying significance 
threshold of 0.05 (Raudvere U et al 2019). All tested genes were used 
as background.

\details{
The object is a named \code{list} with 2 entries. The 'result' entry 
contains a \code{data.frame} with the enrichment analysis results and 
the 'meta' entry contains metadata information.
