Cytoscape network}
\usage{
createNetwork(

  source = c("TERM_ID", "GO:MF", "GO:CC", "GO:BP", "KEGG", "REAC", "TF", "MIRNA", "HPA",
    "CORUM", "HP", "WP"),

\arguments{
\item{gostObject}{a \code{list} created by gprofiler2 that contains
the results from an enrichment analysis.}

\item{source}{a \code{character} string representing the selected source 
that will be used to generate the network. To hand-pick the terms to be 
used, "TERM_ID" should be used and the list of selected term IDs should
be passed through the \code{termIDs} parameter. The possible sources are 
"GO:BP" for Gene Ontology Biological Process, "GO:CC" for Gene Ontology  
Cellular Component, "GO:MF" for Gene Ontology Molecular Function, 
"KEGG" for Kegg, "REAC" for Reactome, "TF" for TRANSFAC, "MIRNA" for 
miRTarBase, "CORUM" for CORUM database, "HP" for Human phenotype ontology
and "WP" for WikiPathways.  Default: "TERM_ID".}

\item{termIDs}{a \code{vector} of \code{character} strings that contains the
term IDS retained for the creation of the network. Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{removeRoot}{a \code{logical} that specified if the root terms of 
the selected source should be removed (when present). Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{title}{a \code{character} string representing the name assigned to 
the network. Default: "gprofiler network".}

\item{collection}{a \code{character} string representing the collection 
name assigned to the network. Default: "enrichment results".}

\item{fileName}{a \code{character} string representing the name of the
CX JSON file that is created when Cytoscape is not running. The name 
must have a '.cx' extension.
Default: "gprofilerNetwork_01.cx".}

\code{TRUE}

\description{
User selected enrichment terms are used to create a Cytoscape 
network where the selected terms and the genes that where part of the 
enrichment analysis are all represented as nodes. Edges are linking the 
genes to their terms. The selection of the term can by specifying  the 
source of the terms (GO:MF, REAC, TF, etc...) or by listing the selected 
term IDs. The network is only generated when there is at least on 
significant term to graph.

## Loading dataset containing result from an enrichment analysis done with
## gprofiler2
data(demoGOST)

## Create network for Gene Ontology - Molecular Function related results
## in Cytoscape (when the application is opened)
## Otherwise, create a CX file in the temporary directory
## The file can be opened in Cytoscape
