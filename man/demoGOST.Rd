\title{All samples information, formated by \code{methylKit}, in a
\code{methylRawList} format (for demo purpose).}
\format{
A \code{list} containing three \code{methylRawList} objects. Each
\code{methylRawList} contains the information for one generation
(first entry = first generation, etc..). Each sample information is
stored in a \code{methylRaw} object. There is \code{methylRaw} objects
(6 controls and 6 cases) in each generation.

\value{
A \code{list} containing three \code{methylRawList} objects. Each

}
\description{
The object is a \code{list} with 3 entries. Each entry corresponds to the
information for one generation (first entry = first generation, etc..)
stored in a \code{methylRawList}.
There are 12 samples (6 controls and 6 cases) for each generation. Each
sample information is stored in a \code{methylRaw} object.
}
\details{
This dataset can be
used to test the \code{runPermutation} function.
