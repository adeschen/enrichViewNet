# Introduction

Biology studies that use high-throughput technologies, such as RNA sequencing 
or microarray platform, usually end up generating large amount of data such 
as gene lists. For instance, RNA sequencing is frequently uses to discover 
genes that have differential expression between two biological states 
(such as healthy versus diseased). Those studies can make use of statistical 
tools that enable positioning those novel gene lists against previous 
knowledge.

Functional enrichment analysis tools, such as _Enrichr_ [@Kuleshov2016] and 
_DAVID_ [@Dennis2003], specialize in positioning novel findings against 
well curated data sources of biological processes and pathways. Most 
specifically, those tools identify functionally coherent gene sets that are 
statistically over- (or under-) represented in a gene list. The 
traditional output of enrichment analysis tool is a table containing the
significant gene sets with their associated statistics. While those results
are extremely useful, their interpretation is not always easy. In that 
respect, visual representation of the results as network could be handy. 

Biological network models are visual representation of various biological 
interacting elements which are based on mathematical graphs. In those 
networks, the biological elements are generally represented by nodes while 
the interactions and relationships are represented by edges. One of the 
wildly used network tool in the quantitative biology community is the 
open source software _Cytoscape_. In addition of biological data 
visualization and network
analysis, _Cytoscape_ can be expended through the use of 
specialized plug-ins such as _BiNGO_ that calculates over-represented GO terms 
in a network [@Maere2005] or _CentiScaPe_ that identifies relevant network 
nodes [@Scardoni2009]. 

The _g:Profiler_ enrichment  analysis tool [@Raudvere2019] is web based as 
the particularity of being accompanied by the CRAN package 
_gprofiler2_ [@Kolberg2020]. The _gprofiler2_ package enables researchers to 
incorporate functional enrichment analysis into automated analysis pipelines 
written in R. This greatly facilitates research reproducibility. 

The `r Githubpkg("adeschen/gprofiler2cytoscape")` package enables the 
visualization of enrichment results generated by _gprofiler2_ as 
customisable _Cytoscape_ network [@PaulShannon2003]. In the biological 
networks generated by `r Githubpkg("adeschen/gprofiler2cytoscape")`, both 
gene datasets (GO terms/pathways/protein complexes) and genes associated 
to the datasets are represented as nodes. While the edges connect each gene 
to its dataset(s). Only genes present in the query used for the
enrichment analysis are shown.

```{r graphDemo01, echo = FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.cap="Demo a biologocial network where GO terms and genes are presented as nodes while edges connect each gene to its dataset(s).", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("demo01.jpeg")
```

The **_gprofiler2cytoscape_** package 
offers the option to generate a network for only a portion of the 
significant terms by selecting the source or by providing a 
specific list of terms.

Once the network is created, the user can personalize the visual attributes 
and integrate external information such as expression profiles, phenotypes 
and other molecular states. The user can also peforms network analysis.

# Installation

To install the latest version accessible on the 
`r Githubpkg("adeschen/gprofiler2cytoscape")` Github Website, the 
`r CRANpkg("devtools")` package is required.

```{r installDemo01, eval=FALSE}
## Load required package
library(devtools)

## Install the latest version of gprofiler2cytoscape
devtools::install_github('adeschen/gprofiler2cytoscape')
```

It is also possible to install an official release. The list of available 
releases is posted on the [gprofiler2cytoscape Release Website](https://github.com/adeschen/gprofiler2cytoscape/releases "gprofiler2cytoscape Release Site").

```{r installDemo02, eval=FALSE}
## Load required package
library(devtools)

## Install the version v0.1 of gprofiler2cytoscape
## using 'ref' parameter
devtools::install_github('adeschen/gprofiler2cytoscape', ref = "v0.1")
```
